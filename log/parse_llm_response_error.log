We propose a novel algorithm called <span class="font-semibold">DynamicExplore</span> that combines the strengths of the Random Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and the Dynamic Stage Selection Algorithm. This approach dynamically adjusts the selection process based on the exploration ratio, balancing between thorough exploration and efficient convergence. The algorithm maintains a record of visited nodes and dynamically selects the next node based on the exploration ratio and the proximity to the destination node.
</start>

```python
def select_next_node(current_node, destination_node, unvisited_nodes, distance_matrix):
    # Calculate the exploration ratio
    visited_ratio = 1 - len(unvisited_nodes) / len(distance_matrix)
    
    # Determine the selection criteria based on the exploration ratio
    if visited_ratio < 0.7:
        # Select the node with the most unvisited neighbors
        nearest_neighbors = [n for n in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[current_node][n] < distance_matrix[destination_node][n]]
        return max(nearest_neighbors, key=lambda x: len([m for m in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[x][m] < distance_matrix[current_node][m]])
    else:
        # Converge to the nearest unvisited node
        return min(unvisited_nodes, key=lambda x: distance_matrix[current_node][x])

I'll create a new algorithm called the "Dynamic-Adaptive Route Optimization Algorithm" (DARO-Algorithm). This algorithm combines elements from both the dynamic phase exploration algorithm (Algorithm 1) and the maximum-minimum distance balance algorithm (Algorithm 2) to create a more robust and efficient route optimization solution.

The DARO-Algorithm works by first performing a dynamic exploration phase where it selects the next node based on a combination of unvisited nodes and their distances from the current node. Once a certain percentage of nodes have been visited (determined by the unvisited_nodes ratio), it transitions to a balance phase where it selects the next node based on a weighted combination of the current distance and the minimum future distance to unvisited nodes.

This approach allows the algorithm to first explore the most promising paths while also ensuring that it converges towards an optimal route by balancing current and future distances.
</start>

```python
def select_next_node(current_node, destination_node, unvisited_nodes, distance_matrix):
    # Dynamic phase exploration: prioritize nodes with fewer connections
    visited_ratio = 1 - len(unvisited_nodes) / len(distance_matrix)
    if visited_ratio < 0.7:
        # Select the node with the fewest connections
        next_node = max(unvisited_nodes, key=lambda x: len([n for n in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[x][n] < distance_matrix[current_node][n]])
    else:
        # Balance phase: prioritize nodes with the smallest future distance
        best_score = -float('inf')
        best_node = unvisited_nodes[0]
        for node in unvisited_nodes:
            current_dist = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
            min_future_dist = min([distance_matrix[node][n] for n in unvisited_nodes if n != node])
            score = 0.7 * (1 / current_dist) + 0.3 * (1 / min_future_dist)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_node = node
        next_node = best_node
    return next_node
```
