def select_next_node(current_node, destination_node, unvisited_nodes, distance_matrix):
    # Algorithm description: This algorithm combines the strengths of the two provided algorithms.
    # It first performs a density-based exploration to identify high-density regions, then uses a dynamic
    # exploration strategy that prioritizes nodes with fewer connections in the early stages and
    # higher connections in the latter stages.
    # Implementation steps:
    # 1. Calculate the density scores for all unvisited nodes based on the distance matrix.
    # 2. Identify the nodes with the highest density scores.
    # 3. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore these high-density regions.
    # 4. In the early stages, prioritize nodes with fewer connections to explore less dense areas.
    # 5. In the latter stages, prioritize nodes with more connections to converge on the optimal path.
    # Return the next node based on the dynamic exploration strategy.
